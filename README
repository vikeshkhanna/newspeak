NewSpeak is a Google Chrome Extension that converts common short hand words into proper English. A c++ file uses a dictionary mapping to create a trie that is serialized into a json object file subsequently loaded by the extension's scripts. The conversion has a time complexity of O(n) because of the trie but since the entire trie is loaded in memory, the space complexity isn't the best. A better  approach for larger scale dictionaries would be to run the translator as a remote service and send queries to this service for conversion. The trie would then be restricted to that remote process leading to better performance on client side.
